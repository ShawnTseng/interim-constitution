# Cardano 區塊鏈生態系統臨時憲法

### 序言

這是一份臨時的最低可行憲法，包含了實施 CIP-1694 所需的條款和保障措施。此憲法僅作為暫時使用，最終憲法需由 Ada 持有者批准，預計將於 2024 年底或 2025 年初完成。因此，最終憲法可能會根據 Cardano 社群的需求，與此臨時憲法有所不同，甚至有重大差異。在 2024 年，將會在全球各地舉辦一系列研討會，讓 Cardano 社群參與最終憲法的制定過程。此外，最終憲法在生效前必須獲得 Ada 持有者的批准，預計在 2025 年初進行。然而，鑑於 2024 年將啟動鏈上治理，需要在最終憲法獲批之前建立穩健的憲法及憲法委員會，此臨時憲法必須包含必要的條款和保障措施，以支持和滿足 CIP-1694 的需求，確保臨時憲法中的原則不受妥協，直到最終憲法獲得批准為止。

在制定這份臨時憲法時，必須明白這不是僅針對區塊鏈的憲法，而是針對區塊鏈生態系統的憲法——這是一項更具雄心的計畫。因此，雖然治理行為如何獲得批准非常重要，但這並不是這份臨時憲法的唯一重點。這份臨時憲法提供了一個基礎和框架，讓Cardano區塊鏈生態系統中的所有參與者可以一起治理，並開創全新的互動與合作方式。它承認並授權憲法委員會，確認Cardano社群參與合作機構的權利，實施鏈上治理，並授權委任代表（DReps）在鏈上投票中代表Ada持有者的聲音。臨時憲法還認識到在過渡期間保障Cardano國庫資金的使用，並納入Cardano保障措施來實現這一點。

### 前言

在Cardano區塊鏈生態系統的創立初期，IOHK、Emurgo和Cardano基金會這三個先驅組織攜手合作，推動了Cardano區塊鏈的誕生，為這個去中心化網絡奠定了基礎，旨在賦予個人權力，並促進合作與創新。他們的努力為區塊鏈的發展指引了方向，確保所有參與者都能在公平透明的環境中，為Cardano區塊鏈生態系統的成長和成功做出貢獻。

隨著時間推移，Cardano區塊鏈生態系統大幅擴展，現今由數千名ADA持有者、個人、建設者、開發者、企業、質押池以及Cardano區塊鏈的使用者等組成，實現了真正的去中心化運作，進一步強化了Cardano區塊鏈生態系統的韌性與自主性。隨著Cardano區塊鏈生態系統持續成長，其治理模式也必須適時調整與演進，以反映自其創立以來一直秉持的去中心化、社群參與、包容性和合作的原則。

為了建立一個更強大且靈活的治理框架，並在治理過程中盡可能利用區塊鏈技術的優勢，Cardano社群作為這個去中心化生態系統的成員，特此制定《Cardano臨時憲法》。這份憲法將作為我們集體行動和治理的指導方針，讓所有參與者都有機會為Cardano區塊鏈生態系統的發展和進步做出貢獻。

Cardano社群承諾共同遵守這份《臨時憲法》的原則，並攜手努力，不斷提升、壯大和推動我們稱為Cardano區塊鏈的去中心化生態系統邁向成功。

這份《臨時憲法》體現了Cardano區塊鏈去中心化生態系統的運作與治理指導原則，並將隨著時間的推移進行調整與演進，以滿足Cardano社群不斷變化的需求。所有Cardano社群的成員都應遵守這份《臨時憲法》，並有權參與治理過程，包括完成最終《憲法》並由ADA持有者進行表決通過。我們鼓勵所有成員攜手合作，共同為Cardano區塊鏈生態系統的發展、永續性及成功做出貢獻。

## APPENDIX I: CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN GUARDRAILS

### 1 INTRODUCTION

To implement Cardano Blockchain on-chain governance pursuant to CIP-1694,
it is necessary to establish sensible guardrails that will enable the
Cardano Blockchain to continue to operate in a secure and sustainable way.

This Appendix sets forth guardrails that must be applied to Cardano Blockchain
on-chain governance actions, including changes to the protocol parameters
and limits on treasury withdrawals.
These guardrails cover both essential, intrinsic limits on settings,
and recommendations that are based on experience, measurement
and governance objectives.

These guardrails are designed to avoid unexpected problems with the operation of
the Cardano Blockchain.
They are intended to guide the choice of sensible parameter settings and avoid
potential problems with security, performance or functionality.
As described below, some of these guardrails are automatable and will be
enforced via an on-chain script or built-in ledger rules.

These guardrails apply to the Cardano Blockchain Layer 1 mainnet environment.
They are not intended to apply to test environments or to other blockchains
that use the Cardano Blockchain software.

Not all parameters for the Cardano Blockchain can be considered independently.
Some parameters interact with other settings in an intrinsic way.
Where known, these interactions are addressed in this Appendix.

While the guardrails in this Appendix presently reflect the current state of
technical insight, this Appendix should be treated as a living document.
Implementation improvements, new simulations or performance evaluation results
for the Cardano Blockchain may allow some of the restrictions contained in these
guardrails to be relaxed (or, in some circumstances, require them to be
tightened) in due course.
Additional guardrails may also be needed where, for example,
new protocol parameters are introduced.
The guardrails set forth in this Appendix may be amended from time to time
pursuant to an on-chain governance action that satisfies the applicable
voting threshold.
Any such amendment to any guardrails shall require and be deemed to be
an amendment to the Constitution itself.

#### Terminology and Guidance

**Should/Should not.**  Where this Appendix says that a value "should not"
be set below or above some value, this means that the guardrail is a
recommendation or guideline, and the specific value could be open to discussion
or alteration by a suitably expert group recognized by the Cardano community
in light of experience with the Cardano Blockchain governance system or the
operation of the Cardano Blockchain.

**Must/Must not.**  Where this Appendix says that a value "must not" be set
below or above some value, this means that the guardrail is a requirement that
will be enforced by Cardano Blockchain ledger rules, types or other built-in
mechanisms where possible, and that if not followed could cause a
protocol failure, security breach or other undesirable outcome.

**Benchmarking.** Benchmarking refers to careful system level
performance evaluation that is designed to show a-priori that, for example,
95% of blocks will be diffused across a global network of Cardano Blockchain
nodes within the required 5s time interval in all cases.
This may require construction of specific test workflows and execution on a
large test network of Cardano nodes,
simulating a global Cardano Blockchain network.

**Performance analysis.**  Performance analysis refers to projecting theoretical
performance, empirical benchmarking or simulation results to predict actual
system behavior.
For example, performance results obtained from tests in a controlled test
environment (such as a collection of data centers with known networking
properties) may be extrapolated to inform likely performance behavior in a real
Cardano Blockchain network environment.

**Simulation.**  Simulation refers to synthetic execution that is designed to
inform performance/functionality decisions in a repeatable way.
For example, the IOSim Cardano Blockchain module allows the operation of the
networking stack to be simulated in a controlled and repeatable way,
allowing issues to be detected before code deployment.

**Performance Monitoring.**  Performance monitoring involves measuring the
actual behavior of the Cardano Blockchain network, for example,
by using timing probes to evaluate round-trip times,
or test blocks to assess overall network health.
It complements benchmarking and performance analysis by providing information
about actual system behavior that cannot be obtained using simulated workloads
or theoretical analysis.

**Reverting Changes.**  Where performance monitoring shows that actual
network behavior following a change is inconsistent with the performance
requirements for the Cardano Blockchain, then the change must be reverted to its
previous state if that is possible.
For example, if the block size is increased from 100KB to 120KB and 95% of
blocks are no longer diffused within 5s, then a change must be made to revert
the block size to 100KB.
If this is not possible, then one or more alternative changes must be made that
will ensure that the performance requirements are met.

**Severity Levels.**  Issues that affect the Cardano Blockchain network are
classified by severity level, where:

- Severity 1 is a critical incident or issue with very high impact to the
security, performance or functionality of the Cardano Blockchain network
- Severity 2 is a major incident or issue with significant impact to the
security, performance or functionality of the Cardano Blockchain network
- Severity 3 is a minor incident or issue with low impact to the security,
performance or functionality of the Cardano Blockchain network

**Future Performance Requirements.** Planned development such as new mechanisms
for out-of-memory storage may impact block diffusion or other times.
When changing parameters, it is necessary to consider these future performance
requirements as well as the current operation of the Cardano Blockchain.
Until development is complete, the requirements will be
conservative; they may then be relaxed to account for actual timing behavior.

#### Automated Checking ("Guardrails Script")

A script hash is associated with the constitution hash when an
**New Constitution or Guardrails Script** governance action is enacted.
It acts as an additional safeguard to the ledger rules and types,
filtering non-compliant governance actions.

The guardrails script only affects two types of governance actions:

- **Parameter Update** actions, and
- **Treasury Withdrawal** actions.

The script is executed when either of these types of governance action is
submitted on-chain.
This avoids scenarios where, for example, an erroneous script could prevent
the chain from ever enacting a Hard Fork action, resulting in deadlock.
There are three different situations that apply to script usage.

**Symbol and Explanation**

- (y) The script can be used to enforce the guardrail.
- (x) The script cannot be used to enforce the guardrail.
- (~ - reason) The script cannot be used to enforce the guardrail for the
reason given, but future ledger changes could enable this.

Guardrails may overlap: in this case, the most restrictive set of guardrails
will apply.

Where a parameter is not explicitly listed in this document,
then the script **must not** permit any changes to the parameter.

Conversely, where a parameter is explicitly listed in this document
but no checkable guardrails are specified, the script **must not** impose any
constraints on changes to the parameter.

### 2 GUARDRAILS AND GUIDELINES ON PROTOCOL PARAMETER UPDATE ACTIONS

Below are guardrails and guidelines for changing updatable
protocol parameter settings via the protocol parameter update governance action
such that the Cardano Blockchain is never in an unrecoverable state as
a result of such changes.

Note that there are at least five different sources of parameter names,
and these are not always consistent:

1. The name used in the Genesis file
2. The name used in protocol parameter update governance actions
3. The name used internally in ledger rules
4. The name used in the formal ledger specification
5. The name used in research papers

Where these parameter names differ, this Appendix uses the second convention.

###### Guardrails

PARAM-01 (y)  Any protocol parameter that is not explicitly named in this
document **must not** be changed by a Parameter update governance action

PARAM-02 (y) Where a protocol parameter is explicitly listed in this document
but no checkable guardrails are specified, the guardrails script **must not**
impose any constraints on changes to the parameter.
Checkable guardrails are shown by a (y)

#### 2.1 Critical Protocol Parameters

The below protocol parameters are critical from a security point of view.

##### Parameters that are Critical to the Operation of the Blockchain

- *maximum block body size* (*maxBlockBodySize*)
- *maximum transaction size* (*maxTxSize*)
- *maximum block header size* (*maxBlockHeaderSize*)
- *maximum size of a serialized asset value* (*maxValueSize*)
- *maximum script execution/memory units in a single block*
(*maxBlockExecutionUnits[steps/memory]*)
- *minimum fee coefficient* (*txFeePerByte*)
- *minimum fee constant* (*txFeeFixed*)
- *minimum fee per byte for reference scripts* (*minFeeRefScriptCoinsPerByte*)
- *minimum Lovelace deposit per byte of serialized UTxO* (*utxoCostPerByte*)
- *governance action deposit* (*govDeposit*)

###### Guardrails

PARAM-03 (y)  Critical protocol  parameters require an SPO vote in addition
to a DRep vote: SPOs **must** say "yes" with a collective support of more than
50% of all active block production stake.
This is enforced by the guardrails on the stake pool voting threshold.

PARAM-04 (x)  At least 3 months **should** normally pass between
the publication of an off-chain proposal to change a
critical protocol parameter and the submission of the corresponding
on-chain governance action.
This guardrail may be relaxed in the event of a Severity 1 or Severity 2
network issue following careful technical discussion and evaluation.

##### Parameters that are Critical to the Governance System

- *delegation key Lovelace deposit* (*stakeAddressDeposit*)
- *pool registration Lovelace deposit* (*stakePoolDeposit*)
- *minimum fixed rewards cut for pools* (*minPoolCost*)
- *DRep deposit amount* (*dRepDeposit*)
- *minimal Constitutional Committee size* (*committeeMinSize*)
- *maximum term length (in epochs) for the Constitutional Committee members*
(*committeeMaxTermLimit*)

###### Guardrails

PARAM-05 (y)  DReps **must** vote "yes" with a collective support of more than
50% of all active voting stake.
This is enforced by the guardrails on the DRep voting thresholds.

PARAM-06 (x)  At least 3 months **should** normally pass between the
publication of an off-chain proposal to change a parameter that is critical
to the governance system and the submission of the corresponding on-chain
governance action.
This guardrail may be relaxed in the event of a Severity 1 or Severity 2
network issue following careful technical discussion and evaluation.

#### 2.2 Economic Parameters

The overall goals when managing economic parameters are to:

1. Enable long-term economic sustainability for the
Cardano Blockchain ecosystem;
2. Ensure that stake pools are adequately rewarded for maintaining the
Cardano Blockchain;
3. Ensure that Ada holders are adequately rewarded for using stake
in constructive ways, including when delegating ada for block production; and
4. Balance economic incentives for different Cardano Blockchain ecosystem
stakeholders, including but not limited to Stake Pool Operators, Ada holders,
DeFi users, infrastructure users, developers (e.g. DApps)
and financial intermediaries (e.g. exchanges)

##### Triggers for Change

1. Significant changes in the fiat value of Ada resulting in
potential problems with security, performance or functionality
2. Changes in transaction volumes or types
3. Community requests or suggestions
4. Emergency situations that require changes to economic parameters

##### Counter-indicators

Changes to the economic parameters should not be made in isolation.
They need to account for:

- External economic factors
- Network security concerns

##### Core Metrics

- Fiat value of Ada resulting in potential problems with security,
performance or functionality
- Transaction volumes and types
- Number and health of stake pools
- External economic factors

#### Changes to Specific Economic Parameters

##### Transaction fee per byte (txFeePerByte) and fixed transaction fee (txFeeFixed)

Defines the cost for basic transactions in Lovelace:

*fee(tx) = txFeeFixed + txFeePerByte x nBytes(tx)*

###### Guardrails

TFPB-01 (y) *txFeePerByte* **must not** be lower than 30 (0.000030 ada)
This protects against low-cost denial of service attacks

TFPB-02 (y) *txFeePerByte* **must not** exceed 1,000 (0.001 ada)
This ensures that transactions can be paid for

TFPB-03 (y) *txFeePerByte* **must not** be negative

TFF-01 (y) *txFeeFixed* **must not** be lower than 100,000  (0.1 ada)
This protects against low-cost denial of service attacks

TFF-02 (y) *txFeeFixed* **must not** exceed 10,000,000 (10 ada)
This ensures that transactions can be paid for

TFF-03 (y) *txFeeFixed* **must not** be negative

TFGEN-01 (x - "should") To maintain a consistent level of protection against
denial-of-service attacks, *txFeeFixed* and *txFeeFixed* **should** be adjusted
whenever Plutus Execution prices are adjusted
(executionUnitPrices[steps/memory])

TFGEN-02 (x - unquantifiable) Any changes to  *txFeeFixed* or *txFeeFixed*
**must** consider the implications of reducing the cost of a
denial-of-service attack or increasing the maximum transaction fee so that
it becomes impossible to construct a transaction.

##### UTxO cost per byte (utxoCostPerByte)

Defines the cost for storage in UTxOs

- Sets a minimum threshold on ada that is held within a single UTxO
(~1 ada minimum, could be >= 50 ada in the worst case)
- Provides protection against low-cost denial of service attack on UTxO storage.
This attack has been executed on other chains - it is not theoretical.
DoS protection decreases in line with the free node memory
(proportional to UTxO growth)
- Helps reduce long term storage costs
- Provides an incentive to return UTxOs when no longer needed.
Should significantly exceed minimum tx cost (~ 0.15 ada)

###### Guardrails

UCPB-01 (y) *utxoCostPerByte* **must not** be lower than 3,000 (0.003 ada)

UCPB-02 (y) *utxoCostPerByte* **must not** exceed 6,500 (0.0065 ada)

UCPB-03 (y) *utxoCostPerByte* **must not** be zero

UCPB-04 (y) *utxoCostPerByte* **must not** be negative

UCPB-05 (x - "should") Changes **should** account for
i) The acceptable cost of attack
ii) The acceptable time for an attack (at least one epoch is assumed)
iii) The acceptable memory configuration for full node users
(assumed to be 16GB for wallets or 24GB for stake pools)
iv) The sizes of UTxOs (~200B per UTxO minimum, up to about 10KB) and
v) The current total node memory usage

##### Stake address deposit (stakeAddressDeposit)

Ensures that stake addresses are retired when no longer needed

- Helps reduce long term storage costs
- Helps limit CPU and memory costs in the ledger

The rationale for the deposit is to incentivize that scarce memory resources
are returned when they are no longer required.
Reducing the number of active stake addresses also reduces processing and
memory costs at the epoch boundary when calculating stake snapshots.

###### Guardrails

SAD-01 (y) *stakeAddressDeposit* **must not** be lower than 1,000,000 (1 ada)

SAD-02 (y) *stakeAddressDeposit* **must not** exceed 5,000,000 (5 ada)

SAD-03 (y) *stakeAddressDeposit* **must not** be negative

##### Stake pool deposit (stakePoolDeposit)

Ensures that stake pools are retired by the stake pool operator when no longer
needed by them

- Helps reduce long term storage costs

The rationale for the deposit is to incentivize that scarce memory resources
are returned when they are no longer required.
Rewards and stake snapshot calculations are also impacted by the number of
active stake pools.

###### Guardrails

SPD-01 (y) *stakePoolDeposit* **must not** be lower than 250,000,000 (250 ada)

SPD-02 (y) *stakePoolDeposit* **must not** exceed 500,000,000 (500 ada)

SPD-03 (y) *stakePoolDeposit* **must not** be negative

##### Minimum Pool Cost (minPoolCost)

Part of the rewards mechanism

- The minimum pool cost is transferred to the pool rewards address before
any delegator rewards are paid

###### Guardrails

MPC-01 (y) *minPoolCost* **must not** be negative

MPC-02 (y) *minPoolCost* **must not** exceed 500,000,000 (500 ada)

MPC-03 (x - "should") *minPoolCost* **should** be set in line with the
economic cost for operating a pool

##### Treasury Cut (treasuryCut)

Part of the rewards mechanism

- The treasury cut portion of the monetary expansion is transferred to the
treasury before any pool rewards are paid
- Can be set in the range 0.0-1.0 (0%-100%)

###### Guardrails

TC-01 (y) *treasuryCut* **must not** be lower than 0.1 (10%)

TC-02 (y) *treasuryCut* **must not** exceed 0.3 (30%)

TC-03 (y) *treasuryCut* **must not** be negative

TC-04 (y) *treasuryCut* **must not** exceed 1.0 (100%)

TC-05 (~ - no access to change history)  *treasuryCut* **must not** be changed
more than once in any 36 epoch period (approximately 6 months)

##### Monetary Expansion Rate (monetaryExpansion)

Part of the rewards mechanism

- The monetary expansion controls the amount of reserves that is used for
rewards each epoch

Governs the long-term sustainability of Cardano

- The reserves are gradually depleted until no rewards are supplied

###### Guardrails

ME-01 (y) *monetaryExpansion* **must not** exceed 0.005

ME-02 (y) *monetaryExpansion* **must not** be lower than 0.001

ME-03 (y) *monetaryExpansion* **must not** be negative

ME-04 (x - "should") *monetaryExpansion* **should not** be varied by more than
+/- 10% in any 73-epoch period (approximately 12 months)

ME-05 (x - "should") *monetaryExpansion* **should not** be changed more than
once in any 36-epoch period (approximately 6 months)

##### Plutus Script Execution Prices (executionUnitPrices[priceSteps/priceMemory])

Define the fees for executing Plutus scripts

Gives an economic return for Plutus script execution

Provides security against low-cost DoS attacks

###### Guardrails

EIUP-PS-01 (y) *executionUnitPrices[priceSteps]* **must not** exceed
2,000 / 10,000,000

EIUP-PS-02 (y) *executionUnitPrices[priceSteps]* **must not** be lower than
500 / 10,000,000

EIUP-PM-01 (y) *executionUnitPrices[priceMemory]* **must not** exceed
2,000 / 10,000

EIUP-PM-02 (y) *executionUnitPrices[priceMemory]* **must not** be lower than

cost of a maximum sized non-script transaction and
ii) the cost of executing a transaction with maximum memory units is similar to
the cost of a maximum sized non-script transaction

EIUP-GEN-02 (x - "should") The execution prices **should** be adjusted
whenever transaction fees are adjusted (*txFeeFixed/txFeePerByte*).
The goal is to ensure that the processing delay is similar for
"full" transactions, regardless of their type.
This helps ensure that the requirements on block diffusion/propagation times
are met.

**must** consider the implications of reducing the cost of a
denial-of-service attack or increasing the maximum transaction fee

#### 2.3 Network Parameters

The overall goals when managing the Cardano Blockchain network parameters are
to:

1. Match the available Cardano Blockchain Layer 1 network capacity to current
or future traffic demands, including payment transactions, layer 1 DApps,
sidechain management and governance needs
2. Balance traffic demands for different user groups, including
payment transactions, minters of Fungible/Non-Fungible Tokens, Plutus scripts,
DeFi developers, Stake Pool Operators and voting transactions

##### Triggers for Change

Changes to network parameters may be triggered by:

1. Measured changes in traffic demands over a 2-epoch period (10 days)
2. Anticipated changes in traffic demands
3. Community requests

##### Counter-indicators

Changes may need to be reversed and/or should not be enacted in the event of:

- Excessive block propagation delays
- Stake pools being unable to handle traffic volume
- Scripts being unable to complete execution

##### Core Metrics

All decisions on parameter changes should be informed by:

- Block propagation delay profile
- Traffic volume (block size over time)
- Script volume (size of scripts and execution units)
- Script execution cost benchmarks
- Block propagation delay/diffusion benchmarks

Detailed benchmarking results are required to confirm the effect of any changes
on mainnet performance or behavior prior to enactment.
The effects of different transaction mixes must be analyzed,
including normal transactions, Plutus scripts, and governance actions.

50% of the active voting stake.

### 4 GUARDRAILS AND GUIDELINES ON HARD FORK INITIATION ACTIONS

The **hard fork initiation** action requires both a new major and a new minor
protocol version to be specified.

- As positive integers

As the result of a hard fork, new updatable protocol parameters may be
introduced.
Guardrails may be defined for these parameters,
which will take effect following the hard fork.

in which case the guardrails become obsolete for all future changes.

###### Guardrails

HARDFORK-01 (~ - no access to existing parameter values)
The major protocol version **must** be the same as or one greater than
the major version that will be enacted immediately prior to this change.
If the major protocol version is one greater,
then the minor protocol version **must** be zero.

The minor protocol version **must** be no less than the minor version
that will be enacted immediately prior to this change.

HARDFORK-03 (~ - no access to existing parameter values) At least one of the
protocol versions (major or minor or both) **must** change.

HARDFORK-04 (x) At least 85% of stake pools by active stake **should** have

### 9 GUARDRAILS DURING THE INTERIM PERIOD

Interim Period

The Interim Period begins with the Chang Hard-Fork and ends after
a community-ratified Final Constitution is enacted on-chain.
Throughout the Interim Period, technical and constitution-enforced triggers
will progressively turn on the features of CIP-1694.

Interim Period Technical Rollout:

- The Chang Hard Fork will enable three initial CIP-1694 governance actions
and enable the representative framework to be established.
These actions are the **"Info"**, **"Hard-fork initiation"** and
**"Protocol parameter changes"** actions.
Ada holders will be able to register as and delegate to DReps immediately after
the hard fork but, as described in CIP-1694, DRep voting will not be available,
except on **"Info"** actions.
This ensures that Ada holders have sufficient time to choose
their voting delegations.
SPOs will be able to vote as described in CIP-1694.
**"Hard-fork initiation"** and **"Protocol parameter changes"** actions
will also be ratified by the Constitutional Committee.
Ada holders will be able to withdraw their staking rewards as usual.

- A subsequent hard fork, ratified by the Constitutional Committee and SPOs,
shortly after the Chang Hard Fork, will enable the four remaining
CIP-1694 governance actions: **"treasury withdrawals"**,
**"motion of no-confidence"**,
**"update constitutional committee and/or threshold and/or terms"**, and
**"new constitution or guardrails script"**.
At this point, DRep voting will be enabled and staking rewards can only be
withdrawn if the Ada holder has delegated their vote
(including to the pre-defined Abstain/No Confidence voting options).

###### Guardrails

INTERIM-01 (x) To provide sufficient time for DReps to register and
campaign and for Ada holders to choose their initial voting delegations,
at least 18 epochs (90 days, or approximately 3 months) **must** elapse after
the Chang hard fork before the subsequent hard fork can be ratified.
Once the subsequent hard fork is enacted, DRep voting can occur
as described in CIP-1694.

INTERIM-02 (x) Treasury withdrawals **must not** be ratified until there is
a community-approved Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem budget then in effect pursuant
to a previous on-chain governance action.

INTERIM-03 (x) Treasury withdrawals **must** be consistent with the
community-approved Cardano Blockchain ecosystem budget(s).

INTERIM-04 (x) Ada holders **must** have ratified the Final Constitution
as specified in Appendix II before ratifying any other proposed
**"new constitution"**, **"update constitutional committee**
**and/or threshold and/or terms"**, and
**"motion of no-confidence"** governance actions.

INTERIM-05 (x)  **"New guardrails script"** actions
that are consistent with the Interim Constitution may be ratified during
